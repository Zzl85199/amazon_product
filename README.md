# Amazon Product Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project involves analyzing and visualizing data from an Amazon product dataset. The goal is to explore various aspects of the data, such as product pricing, ratings, availability, and more, to gain insights into trends and patterns.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is named `amazon_product.csv`. It contains information on various products listed on Amazon, including:

- **asin**: Amazon Standard Identification Number
- **product_title**: The title of the product
- **product_price**: The price of the product
- **product_star_rating**: The average star rating of the product
- **product_num_ratings**: The number of ratings the product has received
- **is_best_seller**: Whether the product is a best seller
- **is_amazon_choice**: Whether the product is an Amazon's Choice item
- **sales_volume**: The sales volume of the product
- **product_availability**: The availability status of the product
- And many other attributes related to product features and sales.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need to have Python installed on your system along with the following libraries:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `plotly`
- `seaborn`
- `wordcloud`
- `google.colab` (if running on Google Colab)

You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib plotly seaborn wordcloud
```

## Usage

1. **Load the Dataset**: Load the dataset from your Google Drive or local directory.

2. **Data Inspection**: 
   - Use `df.head()` to view the first few rows.
   - Check the shape, data types, and summary statistics using `df.shape`, `df.info()`, and `df.describe()`.

3. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handle missing values and duplicates.
   - Ensure all necessary columns are correctly formatted.

4. **Data Visualization**:
   - Visualize the distribution of categorical columns using bar charts.
   - Visualize the distribution of numerical columns using histograms.
   - Explore correlations between numeric features using a correlation matrix.

5. **Analysis**:
   - Interpret the visualizations to identify trends, anomalies, and interesting insights.
   - Apply further analysis techniques if necessary, such as PCA, clustering, or predictive modeling.

## Future Work

Possible extensions of this project include:

- Analyzing trends over time if time-series data is available.
- Developing a machine learning model to predict product success based on features like pricing, ratings, and availability.
- Integrating with web scraping to gather real-time data for continuous analysis.
